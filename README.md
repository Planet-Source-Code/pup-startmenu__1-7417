## StartMenu


</div>

### Description

This is an enhanced Start menu from the BoS project. I pulled out the explorer functionality and made it standalone. New features include: more natural response to mouse rollover, you can set the font, font size and height of the items, the menu gets the real text width and height at runtime so it can adapt to any font, font size or style. Item spacing can be adjusted by adjusting picItem(0) text and icons are centered vertically at run time. Must See. Thanks to Brian for his COOL BoS. I feel this functionality with its enhancements can be really useful in your projects.
